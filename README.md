# Password-Generator

## Description

- I was motivated by wanting to create a way to have a strong unhackable password.
- I had built this to potentially use the random passwords for anything I may need. whether I could not think of one or wanted an unbreachable one.
- I learned how to use the basic functions of javascript.
- When you click on "generate password" the browser should ask you a series of questions before supplying you with a password
